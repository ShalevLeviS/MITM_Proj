# MITM_Proj
Project Of MITM
The project first use arp poisoning to change the mac and the ip of the "victim" to the mitm mac and ip and vice versa. 
After we poisoned the victim and the router we used proxy to maintain the transformation between the computers.
Finally we created a black list of sites and when the user try to reach them he redirected to a default site.
